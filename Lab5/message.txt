ARTHUR:  Whoa there!
      [clop clop]
 
  GUARD #1:  Halt!  Who goes there?
  ARTHUR:  It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle
      of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign
      of all England!
  GUARD #1:  Pull the other one!
  ARTHUR:  I am.  And this my trusty servant Patsy.
      We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights
      who will join me in my court of Camelot.  I must speak with your lord
      and master.
  GUARD #1:  What, ridden on a horse?
  ARTHUR:  Yes!
  GUARD #1:  You're using coconuts!
  ARTHUR:  What?
  GUARD #1:  You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin'
      'em together.
  ARTHUR:  So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this
      land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--
  GUARD #1:  Where'd you get the coconut?
  ARTHUR:  We found them.
  GUARD #1:  Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!
  ARTHUR:  What do you mean?
  GUARD #1:  Well, this is a temperate zone.
  ARTHUR:  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin
      or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not
      strangers to our land.
  GUARD #1:  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
  ARTHUR:  Not at all, they could be carried.
  GUARD #1:  What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?
  ARTHUR:  It could grip it by the husk!
  GUARD #1:  It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple
      question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound
      coconut.
  ARTHUR:  Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master
      that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
  GUARD #1:  Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow
      needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?
  ARTHUR:  Please!
  GUARD #1:  Am I right?
  ARTHUR:  I'm not interested!
  GUARD #2:  It could be carried by an African swallow!
  GUARD #1:  Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European
      swallow, that's my point.
  GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah, I agree with that...
  ARTHUR:  Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court
      at Camelot?!
  GUARD #1:  But then of course African swallows are not migratory.
  GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah...
  GUARD #1:  So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...
      [clop clop]
  GUARD #2:  Wait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it together?
  GUARD #1:  No, they'd have to have it on a line.
  GUARD #2:  Well, simple!  They'd just use a standard creeper!
  GUARD #1:  What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
  GUARD #2:  Well, why not?

Scene 3
 
      [clop clop]
  ARTHUR:  Old woman!
  DENNIS:  Man!
  ARTHUR: Old Man, sorry.  What knight live in that castle over there?
  DENNIS:  I'm thirty seven.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  DENNIS:  I'm thirty seven -- I'm not old!
  ARTHUR:  Well, I can't just call you `Man'.
  DENNIS:  Well, you could say `Dennis'.
  ARTHUR:  Well, I didn't know you were called `Dennis.'
  DENNIS:  Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?
  ARTHUR:  I did say sorry about the `old woman,' but from the behind
      you looked--
  DENNIS:  What I object to is you automatically treat me like an inferior!
  ARTHUR:  Well, I AM king...
  DENNIS:  Oh king, eh, very nice.  An' how'd you get that, eh?  By
      exploitin' the workers -- by 'angin' on to outdated imperialist dogma
      which perpetuates the economic an' social differences in our society!
      If there's ever going to be any progress--
  WOMAN:  Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here.  Oh -- how d'you do?
  ARTHUR:  How do you do, good lady.  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
      Who's castle is that?
  WOMAN:  King of the who?
  ARTHUR:  The Britons.
  WOMAN:  Who are the Britons?
  ARTHUR:  Well, we all are. we're all Britons and I am your king.
  WOMAN:  I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an autonomous
      collective.
  DENNIS:  You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship.
      A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--
  WOMAN:  Oh there you go, bringing class into it again.
  DENNIS:  That's what it's all about if only people would--
  ARTHUR:  Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  Who lives
      in that castle?
  WOMAN:  No one live there.
  ARTHUR:  Then who is your lord?
  WOMAN:  We don't have a lord.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  DENNIS:  I told you.  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take
      it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
  ARTHUR:  Yes.
  DENNIS:  But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified
      at a special biweekly meeting.
  ARTHUR:  Yes, I see.
  DENNIS:  By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,--
  ARTHUR:  Be quiet!
  DENNIS:  --but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more--
  ARTHUR:  Be quiet!  I order you to be quiet!
  WOMAN:  Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
  ARTHUR:  I am your king!
  WOMAN:  Well, I didn't vote for you.
  ARTHUR:  You don't vote for kings.
  WOMAN:  Well, 'ow did you become king then?
  ARTHUR:  The Lady of the Lake,
      [angels sing]
      her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur
      from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I,
      Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.
      [singing stops]
      That is why I am your king!
  DENNIS:  Listen -- strange women lying in ponds distributing swords
      is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power
      derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical
      aquatic ceremony.
  ARTHUR:  Be quiet!
  DENNIS:  Well you can't expect to wield supreme executive power
      just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
  ARTHUR:  Shut up!
  DENNIS:  I mean, if I went around sayin' I was an empereror just
      because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me they'd
      put me away!
  ARTHUR:  Shut up!  Will you shut up!
  DENNIS:  Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.
  ARTHUR:  Shut up!
  DENNIS:  Oh!  Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
      HELP! HELP! I'm being repressed!
  ARTHUR:  Bloody peasant!
  DENNIS:  Oh, what a give away.  Did you here that, did you here that,
      eh?  That's what I'm on about -- did you see him repressing me,
      you saw it didn't you?

Scene 4
 
      [arg]
      [ugh]
      [hah]
 
  ARTHUR:  You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.
      I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
      [pause]
      I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me
      in my Court of Camelot.
      [pause]
      You have proved yourself worthy; will you join me?
      [pause]
      You make me sad.  So be it.  Come, Patsy.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
  ARTHUR:  I have no quarrel with you, good Sir knight, but I must
      cross this bridge.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Then you shall die.
  ARTHUR:  I command you as King of the Britons to stand aside!
  BLACK KNIGHT:  I move for no man.
  ARTHUR:  So be it!
      [hah]
      [parry thrust]
      [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm off]
  ARTHUR:  Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  'Tis but a scratch.
  ARTHUR:  A scratch?  Your arm's off!
  BLACK KNIGHT:  No, it isn't.
  ARTHUR:  Well, what's that then?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  I've had worse.
  ARTHUR:  You liar!
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on you pansy!
      [hah]
      [parry thrust]
      [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right arm off]
  ARTHUR:  Victory is mine!
      [kneeling]
      We thank thee Lord, that in thy merc-
      [hah]
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on then.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Have at you!
  ARTHUR:  You are indeed brave, Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, had enough, eh?
  ARTHUR:  Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Yes I have.
  ARTHUR:  Look!
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Just a flesh wound.
      [bang]
  ARTHUR:  Look, stop that.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Chicken!  Chicken!
  ARTHUR:  Look, I'll have your leg.  Right!
      [whop]
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Right, I'll do you for that!
  ARTHUR:  You'll what?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Come 'ere!
  ARTHUR:  What are you going to do, bleed on me?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  I'm invincible!
  ARTHUR:  You're a loony.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  The Black Knight always triumphs!
      Have at you!  Come on then.
      [whop]
      [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's other leg off]
  BLACK KNIGHT:  All right; we'll call it a draw.
  ARTHUR:  Come, Patsy.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, oh, I see, running away then.  You yellow
      bastards!  Come back here and take what's coming to you.
      I'll bite your legs off!

Scene 5
 
  CROWD:  A witch!  A witch!  A witch!  We've got a witch!  A witch!
  VILLAGER #1:  We have found a witch, might we burn her?
  CROWD:  Burn her!  Burn!
  BEDEMIR:  How do you know she is a witch?
  VILLAGER #2:  She looks like one.
  BEDEMIR:  Bring her forward.
  WITCH:  I'm not a witch.  I'm not a witch.
  BEDEMIR:  But you are dressed as one.
  WITCH:  They dressed me up like this.
  CROWD:  No, we didn't... no.
  WITCH:  And this isn't my nose, it's a false one.
  BEDEMIR:  Well?
  VILLAGER #1:  Well, we did do the nose.
  BEDEMIR:  The nose?
  VILLAGER #1:  And the hat -- but she is a witch!
  CROWD:  Burn her!  Witch!  Witch!  Burn her!
  BEDEMIR:  Did you dress her up like this?
  CROWD:  No, no... no ... yes.  Yes, yes, a bit, a bit.
  VILLAGER #1:  She has got a wart.
  BEDEMIR:  What makes you think she is a witch?
  VILLAGER #3:  Well, she turned me into a newt.
  BEDEMIR:  A newt?
  VILLAGER #3:  I got better.
  VILLAGER #2:  Burn her anyway!
  CROWD:  Burn!  Burn her!
  BEDEMIR:  Quiet, quiet.  Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether
      she is a witch.
  CROWD:  Are there?  What are they?
  BEDEMIR:  Tell me, what do you do with witches?
  VILLAGER #2:  Burn!
  CROWD:  Burn, burn them up!
  BEDEMIR:  And what do you burn apart from witches?
  VILLAGER #1:  More witches!
  VILLAGER #2:  Wood!
  BEDEMIR:  So, why do witches burn?
      [pause]
  VILLAGER #3:  B--... 'cause they're made of wood...?
  BEDEMIR:  Good!
  CROWD:  Oh yeah, yeah...
  BEDEMIR:  So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
  VILLAGER #1:  Build a bridge out of her.
  BEDEMIR:  Aah, but can you not also build bridges out of stone?
  VILLAGER #2:  Oh, yeah.
  BEDEMIR:  Does wood sink in water?
  VILLAGER #1:  No, no.
  VILLAGER #2:  It floats!  It floats!
  VILLAGER #1:  Throw her into the pond!
  CROWD:  The pond!
  BEDEMIR:  What also floats in water?
  VILLAGER #1:  Bread!
  VILLAGER #2:  Apples!
  VILLAGER #3:  Very small rocks!
  VILLAGER #1:  Cider!
  VILLAGER #2:  Great gravy!
  VILLAGER #1:  Cherries!
  VILLAGER #2:  Mud!
  VILLAGER #3:  Churches -- churches!
  VILLAGER #2:  Lead -- lead!
  ARTHUR:  A duck.
  CROWD:  Oooh.
  BEDEMIR:  Exactly!  So, logically...,
  VILLAGER #1:  If... she.. weighs the same as a duck, she's made of wood.
  BEDEMIR:  And therefore--?
  VILLAGER #1:  A witch!
  CROWD:  A witch!
  BEDEMIR:  We shall use my larger scales!
      [yelling]
  BEDEMIR:  Right, remove the supports!
      [whop]
      [creak]
  CROWD:  A witch!  A witch!
  WITCH:  It's a fair cop.
  CROWD:  Burn her!  Burn!  [yelling]
  BEDEMIR:  Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
  ARTHUR:  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
  BEDEMIR:  My liege!
  ARTHUR:  Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,
      and join us at the Round Table?
  BEDEMIR:  My liege!  I would be honored.
  ARTHUR:  What is your name?
  BEDEMIR:  Bedemir, my leige.
  ARTHUR:  Then I dub you Sir Bedemir, Knight of the Round Table.

[Narrative Interlude]
 
  NARRATOR:  The wise Sir Bedemir was the first to join King Arthur's
      knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow:
      Sir Launcelot the Brave; Sir Galahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the
      Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Launcelot who had nearly fought the Dragon
      of Agnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol
      and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and
      the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed
      a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries,
      the Knights of the Round Table.

Scene 6
 
  BEDEMIR:  And that, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
  ARTHUR:  This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedemir.  Explain again how
      sheeps' bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
  BEDEMIR:  Oh, certainly, sir.
  LAUNCELOT:  Look, my liege!
  ARTHUR:  Camelot!
  GALAHAD:  Camelot!
  LAUNCELOT:  Camelot!
  PATSY:  It's only a model.
  ARTHUR:  Shhh!  Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us
      ride... to Camelot.
 
      [singing]
      We're knights of the round table
      We dance when e'er we're able
      We do routines and parlour scenes
      With footwork impecc-Able.
 
      We dine well here in Camelot
      We eat ham and jam and spam a lot
 
      [dancing]
 
      We're knights of the Round Table
      Our shows are for-mid-able
      Though many times we're given rhymes
      That are quite unsing-able
      We not so fat in Camelot
      We sing from the diaphragm a lot
 
      [tap-dancing]
 
      Oh we're tough and able
      Quite indefatigable
      Between our quests we sequin vests
      And impersonate Clark Gable
      It's a bit too loud in Camelot
      I have to push the pram a lot.
 
  ARTHUR:  Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot -- it is
      a silly place.
      Right.

Scene 7
   GOD:  Arthur!  Arthur, King of the Britons!  Oh, don't grovel!  If
      there's one thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.
  ARTHUR:  Sorry--
  GOD:  And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's
      "sorry this" and "forgive me that" and "I'm not worthy".  What are you
      doing now!?
  ARTHUR:  I'm averting my eyes, oh Lord.
  GOD:  Well, don't.  It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so
      depressing.  Now knock it off!
  ARTHUR:  Yes, Lord.
  GOD:  Right!  Arthur, King of the Britons -- your Knights of the Round
      Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.
  ARTHUR:  Good idea, oh Lord!
  GOD: 'Course it's a good idea!  Behold!  Arthur, this is the Holy
      Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek
      this Grail. That is your purpose, Arthur -- the Quest for the
      Holy Grail.
  ARTHUR:  A blessing!
  LAUNCELOT:  A blessing from the Lord!
  GALAHAD:  God be praised!

Scene 8
     [clop clop]
  ARTHUR:  Halt!  Hallo!  Hallo!
  GUARD:  'Allo!  Who is zis?
  ARTHUR:  It is King Arthur, and these are the Knights of the Round
      Table.  Who's castle is this?
  GUARD:  This is the castle of Our Master Ruiz' de lu la Ramper (sp?)
  ARTHUR:  Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God
      with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the
      night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
  GUARD:  Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen...
      Uh, he's already got one, you see?
  ARTHUR:  What?
  GALAHAD:  He says they've already got one!
  ARTHUR:  Are you sure he's got one?
  GUARD:  Oh, yes, it's very nice-a [To Other Guards]  I told him we already got one.
  OTHER GUARDS: [Laughing]
  ARTHUR:  Well, um, can we come up and have a look?
  GUARD:  Of course not!  You are English types-a!
  ARTHUR:  Well, what are you then?
  GUARD:  I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you
      silly king!
  GALAHAD:  What are you doing in England?
  GUARD:  Mind your own business!
  ARTHUR:  If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle
      by force!
  GUARD:  You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your
      bottoms, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called
      Arthur-king, you and all your silly English kaniggets.  Thppppt!
  GALAHAD:  What a strange person.
  ARTHUR:  Now look here, my good man!
  GUARD:  I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty headed animal
      food trough whopper!  I fart in your general direction!  You mother
      was a hamster and your father smelt of eldeberries.
  GALAHAD:  Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
  GUARD:  No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a!
  ARTHUR:  Now, this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonable.
  GUARD:  (Fetchez la vache.)
      wha?
  GUARD:  (Fetchez la vache!)
      [moo]
  ARTHUR:  If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall--
      [twong]
      [mooooooo]
      Jesus Christ!
      Right!  Charge!
  ALL: Charge!
      [mayhem]
  GUARD:  Ah, this one is for your mother!
      [twong]
  ALL:  Run away!
  GUARD:  Thpppt!
  LAUNCELOT:  Fiends!  I'll tear them apart!
  ARTHUR:  No no, no.
  BEDEMIR:  Sir!  I have a plan, sir.
 
      [later]
 
      [chop]
      [mrrrrrreeeeeeaaaaaaauuuuww]
      [rumble rumble squeak]
  MUTTERING GUARDS:  ce labon a bunny do
      wha?
      un cadeau?
      a present!
      oh, un cadeau.
      oui oui hurry!
      wha-?
      let's go!
      [rumble rumble squeak]
 
  ARTHUR:  What happens now?
  BEDEMIR:  Well, now, uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall,
      and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by surprise --
      not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!
  ARTHUR:  Who leaps out?
  BEDEMIR:  Uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I.  Uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh
      and uh....
  ARTHUR:  Oh....
  BEDEMIR:  Oh....  Um, l-look, if we built this large wooden badger--
      [twong]
  ALL:  Run away!  Run away!  Run away!  Run away!
      [splat]
  GUARDS:  Oh, haw haw haw.

Scene 9
 
        Pictures for Schools, take 8.
  DIRECTOR:  Action!
 
  NARRATOR:  Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened
      King Arthur.  The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely
      by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy
      was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought
      to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest
      knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail
      individually.  Now, this is what they did--
      [tromp tromp]
      [slash]
  WOMAN:  Greg!

Scene 10
 
  NARRATOR:  The Tale of Sir Robin....
      So each of the knights went their separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north,
      through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.
 
  MINSTREL (singing):  
                       
                       Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.
                       He was not afraid to die, o Brave Sir Robin.
                       He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.
                       Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!
 
                       He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed
                           into a pulp,
                       Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.
                       To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away,
                       And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!
 
                       His head smashed in and his heart cut out,
                       And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged,
                       And his nostrils ripped and his bottom burned off,
                       And his penis--

  ROBIN:  That's -- that's, uh, that's enough music for now, lads.
      Looks like there's dirty work afoot.
  DENNIS:  Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
  WOMAN:  Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom.  Now I've dropped my mud.
  ALL HEADS:  Halt!  Who art thou?
  MINSTREL (singing):  He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who--
  ROBIN:  Shut up!  Um, n-n-nobody really, I'm j-just um, just passing
      through.
  ALL HEADS:  What do you want?
  MINSTREL (singing):  To fight, and--
  ROBIN:  Shut up!  Um, oo, n-nothing, nothing really -- I, uh, j-j-ust
      to um, just to p-pass through, good Sir knight.
  ALL HEADS:  I'm afraid not!
  ROBIN:  Ah.  W-well, actually I am a Knight of the Round Table.
  ALL HEADS:  You're a Knight of the Round Table?
  ROBIN:  I am.
  LEFT HEAD:  In that case I shall have to kill you.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Shall I?
  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, I don't think so.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Well, what do I think?
  LEFT HEAD:  I think kill him.
  RIGHT HEAD:  Well let's be nice to him.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Oh shut up.
  LEFT HEAD:  Perhaps-
  MIDDLE HEAD:  And you.
  LEFT HEAD:  Oh quick get the sword out I want to cut his head off!
  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, cut your own head off!
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Yes, do us all a favor!
  LEFT HEAD:  What?
  RIGHT HEAD:  Yapping on all the time.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  You're lucky.  You're not next to him.
  LEFT HEAD:  What do you mean?
  MIDDLE HEAD:  You snore.
  LEFT HEAD:  Oh I don't -- anyway, you've got bad breath.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Well its only because you don't brush my teeth.
  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea.
  LEFT HEAD:  All right, all right, all right.  We'll kill him first
      and then have tea and biscuits.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Yes.
  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, but not biscuits.
  LEFT HEAD:  All right, all right, not biscuits, but lets kill him anyway.
  ALL HEADS:  Right!
  LEFT HEAD:  He buggered off.
  RIGHT HEAD:  So he has, he's scarpered.
 
  MINSTREL (singing):  Brave Sir Robin ran away
  ROBIN:  No!
  MINSTREL (singing):  Bravely ran away away
  ROBIN:  I didn't!
  MINSTREL (singing):  When danger reared its ugly head,
                       He bravely turned his tail and fled
  ROBIN:  No!
  MINSTREL (singing):  Yes Brave Sir Robin turned about
  ROBIN:  I didn't!
  MINSTREL (singing):  And gallantly he chickened out
                       Bravely taking to his feet
  ROBIN:  I never did!
  MINSTREL (singing):  He beat a very brave retreat
  ROBIN:  Oh, lie!
  MINSTREL (singing):  Bravest of the brave Sir Robin
  ROBIN:  I never!

  NARRATOR:  The Tale of Sir Galahad
 
      [boom crash]
      [angels singing]
 
      [pound pound pound]
  GALAHAD:  Open the door!
      Open the door!
      [pound pound pound]
      In the name of King Arthur, open the door!
      [squeak thump]
      [squeak boom]
  ALL:  Hello!
  ZOOT:  Welcome gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
  GALAHAD:  The Castle Anthrax?
  ZOOT:  Yes... oh, it's not a very good name?  Oh! but we are
      nice and we shall attend to your every, every need!
  GALAHAD:  You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
  ZOOT:  The what?
  GALAHAD:  The Grail -- it is here?
  ZOOT:  Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!
      Crepper!
  MIDGET and CREPPER:  Yes, oh Zoot!
  ZOOT:  Prepare a bed for our guest.
  MIDGET and CREPPER:  Oh thank you thank you thank you--
  ZOOT:  Away away vile temptress!  The beds here are warm and soft -- and
      very, very big.
  GALAHAD:  Well, look, I-I-uh--
  ZOOT:  What is your name, handsome knight?
  GALAHAD:  Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
  ZOOT:  Mine is Zoot... just Zoot.  Oh, but come!
  GALAHAD:  Look, please!  In God's name, show me the Grail!
  ZOOT:  Oh, you have suffered much!  You are delirious!
  GALAHAD:  L-look, I have seen it!  It is here, in the--
  ZOOT:  Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our
      hospitality.
  GALAHAD:  Well, I-I-uh--
  ZOOT:  Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared
      to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between
      sixteen and nineteen and a half, cut off in this castle with no one to
      protect us!  Oh, it is a lonely life -- bathing, dressing, undressing,
      making exciting underwear....  We are just not used to handsome knights.
      Nay, nay, come, come, you may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded!
  GALAHAD:  No, no -- i-it's nothing!
